# Changelog

All notable changes to `pid-worktree` are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **A window no longer shows the worktree twice.** The ANSI-painted widget line and the status
  belong to a terminal; a host that is not one was handed them *and* the `worktree:binding/v1`
  payload, so PID painted the binding in the session title bar and the stripped string in the
  strip below it. Non-terminal hosts now get only the payload.

### Changed

- **Renamed to `pid-worktree`, everywhere, with the migrations to match.** Package, repository,
  linkage directory (`<git-common-dir>/pid-worktree/`), preferences file
  (`~/.pi/agent/pid-worktree/config.json`), widget and status keys, session entry types and the
  carry-stash label all take the new name. Nothing is asked of the user:
  - links written under the old directory, and the even older single `pi-worktree.json`, are read
    and merged on load;
  - preferences found at the old path are read once and written forward, after which the new file
    answers on its own. The old file is left where it is — it is the user's;
  - cards already written into a session file carry the old `customType`, so that name stays
    registered against the same renderer and old transcripts keep drawing.
- **One session, one tree.** A bare land/abandon resolves only the calling session's own link (or the worktree you're standing in) and never auto-grabs another session's worktree — the `Blocked: … belongs to another session` error is replaced by a `no-own-link` note that lists the others and leaves them alone. Naming a link explicitly still takes it over deliberately, flagged `foreign` with the previous owner named, and the model reports it in chat.
- **No-task `/worktree` never comes back with a question.** With conversation history it infers the pending task and creates the worktree; when nothing is inferable it still creates it and says in one line that it's ready — the old "ask what to work on" escape hatch is gone, because typing `/worktree` means you want the tree. Only with no conversation at all does it create silently and wait for you.
- **Conflicts are the model's job.** `LAND CONFLICT` still names the files in one purple card, but instead of stopping for hand resolution the model reads each file, keeps the intended result from both sides, `git add`s and finishes — explaining what it kept. It only asks the user when both sides look deliberately contradictory.
- **LAND cards separate commits from files.** The commit count and subjects now have their own section, followed by a distinct file count and path list, so the landed history is easy to scan.

### Fixed

- **`/land` on an empty worktree cleans up instead of erroring.** Landing a worktree with no commits and no changes used to fail with `Nothing to land … Use worktree_abandon to drop the worktree`, forcing a second manual step. Now it removes the worktree directory, deletes the branch, clears the link and unbinds the session in one go (`LAND 【x -> main】 · nothing new · cleaned up`). `worktree_abandon` without `confirm:true` also drops empty worktrees immediately — confirmation is only needed when commits or dirty files would be lost.

### Changed

- **Transcript visual language: one diagram tree per card.** Every action renders exactly one purple block: a caps `LABEL` plus the hero in `【】`, then the payload hanging off a `├─`/`└─`/`│` diagram (`WORKTREE` 【main -> x】, `LAND` 【x -> main】 · rebased as a1b2c3d — the verb says what happened, the sha names where the target landed). Counts are bright, nouns dim, names readable; conflict files stay brightest because they need action; the `│` stems are painted like the `├─`/`└─` glyphs so the tree reads as one piece. Every row is listed — no `+N more` cap on commits or files. File rows (`WORKTREE` carried files and `LAND` landed files) are a table: status letter (`N` new, `U` updated, `D` deleted, `R` renamed), path, and `+N`/`-N` line counts with additions green, deletions red, zeros dim; columns are padded to the widest cell so the list reads as a grid and long paths are clipped by display width from the front, keeping the file name. Cards are width-aware and commit subjects **wrap with a hanging indent under the text** instead of being clipped — nothing is hidden, and the tree stays aligned on any terminal. The LAND card shows a `N files checkpointed on <branch>` row only for the origin side — the worktree's own checkpoint is folded into the landed commits it produced, so the same subject never appears twice.
- **`/worktree` is model-driven.** No confirmation, ever. The agent triages dirty files (selective stash via `carryPaths`, saying in one line what it left behind and why) and names the branch itself — no fixed format. Tool-side collisions auto-bump (`-2`, `-3`); an explicit human `--branch` still errors on collision so typos stay visible.
- **`/land` runs straight with zero popups** (`/land [target] [--strategy …]`). The strategy is asked once, remembered globally (`~/.pi/agent/pi-worktree/config.json`), shown on every land line; an explicit `--strategy` wins and becomes the new default. Ambiguity and foreign-owned links surface as purple cards instead of dialogs.
- **Conflict is the one full stop.** A purple `LAND CONFLICT` block names the files and stops — no auto-resolve. The model explains in its own words, asks how to proceed, and never calls `finish:true` without explicit user consent.
- Auto-checkpointed files are announced as their own `DIRTY WORKTREE` section, and land lines carry landed commit subjects plus the file list.
- `worktree_status` renders nothing (triage plumbing); global install tracks the local repo for development.

### Fixed

- **Selective carry no longer dies on a staged deletion.** `git stash push -u -- <path>` fails with `pathspec … did not match any files` when the path names a *staged* deletion (and leaks an empty stash entry doing it), so `worktree_create` with `carryPaths` covering a deleted file reported `carry skipped` and moved nothing. The scope is now expressed as exclusions (`:(exclude,literal)` over the dirty paths that stay behind), which matches index and worktree state alike — deleted files carry, unrelated files stay, no stash leaks.
- **A bad `/land` target is no longer misreported as detached HEAD.** When the target path does not exist (e.g. `/land /repo/然后推送到` — text glued to the path), every git probe fails and `git symbolic-ref` exits 128; that exit code used to be read as "detached HEAD", sending the session hunting for a fix in a target that was never checked out. `isDetached` now trusts only exit 1, and land validates the target with `rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` first, reporting `Target … is not a git work tree — no such directory, or not a repository` (`bad-target`).
- **Stash leak:** `git stash drop` only accepts `stash@{n}` refs, never a raw sha — every carry used to leave an orphan `pi-worktree:*` stash entry. Now locates the entry by sha and drops it; tests assert an empty stash list after carry.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Session binding (virtual cwd).** While a session owns an active worktree, built-in tool calls are re-rooted there via `tool_call`: bash starts inside the worktree, relative and omitted paths resolve against it, and `edit`/`write` aimed at the origin checkout are blocked with the worktree twin. The per-turn policy now states a single `Working root` instead of contradicting the handoff with origin-side facts.
- **`/land` preview and choice.** One-line summary (commits, diff stat, uncommitted files, how far the origin moved) then rebase→ff (default), squash, merge, or edit the commit subject. Conflicts offer agent / abort / manual on the spot. Several children at the origin open a picker.
- **`rebase` land strategy** (default): rebase the worktree onto the origin and fast-forward — linear history, no merge commit. Falls back to merge when the rebase conflicts, after aborting it.
- **`worktree_abandon` tool**: discard a worktree; dry run without `confirm:true` reports what would be lost. Refuses `main`/`master`, other sessions' links, and running from inside the worktree.
- Task text is stored on the link and drives the branch name (`wt-fix-login-retry`), the land commit subject, the widget and the session name.
- Widget readiness: `↑ahead · ↓behind · N dirty`, refreshed after every agent run; terminal title follows the bound worktree.

### Changed

- Store is one file per link in `<git-common-dir>/pi-worktree/`; sessions only write their own link, ending the load-modify-save race between parallel sessions. Legacy `pi-worktree.json` migrates on first load.
- `/worktree` grammar: every positional is task text; explicit branch names go through `--branch`. `/worktree cleanup` is a task again, not a branch.
- `/worktree` with no task and no conversation creates the worktree and waits instead of triggering a turn that has nothing to infer.
- Land/abandon restore the pre-worktree session name (or `✓ <branch>`).
- Detached `HEAD` is now blocked on the target side too; squash with nothing new reports `nothing-to-land` instead of a conflict.
- Target checkpoints are `wip(<branch>): checkpoint before landing …`; source checkpoints use the task as subject.

### Verification

- 35 tests passing (`npm test`), including re-rooting rules, per-link store isolation, legacy migration, rebase→ff and rebase-conflict fallback against real git.
- `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- Print-mode round trip against real Pi: `/worktree add retry tests --yes` → `wt-add-retry-tests` with carried changes → `/land` from inside the worktree lands as a single fast-forwarded commit titled `add retry tests`, cleans up, and restores the session name.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- `/worktree` is one shot: free text after the command is treated as the task (branch names only match single ASCII tokens), the agent auto-continues inside the new worktree, and asks before landing — no more idle script-like stops. Both commands trigger the next model turn instead of queueing `nextTurn` messages.
- Auto branches are short flat `wt-*` (`wt-0904-1111`) and bump `-2`/`-3` on collision, so fresh sessions never hit `already exists`; explicit names still error to keep typos visible.
- `/land` from the origin side auto-flips to the single active child, and dirty targets are checkpoint-committed instead of erroring.
- Display overhaul: two-line result cards (full output one expand away), short widget/status lines, no absolute-path repetition, session renamed to the worktree branch for session isolation.
- Session-exclusive worktrees: links record the owning session; landing another session's active link is blocked for tools and confirm-gated for `/land` (standing inside the worktree counts as possession, so cd-and-land keeps working). The widget/status show only own plus unowned links; the full list stays in `/worktree status` and the model policy.
- Self-healing linkage: every land/widget/create pass reconciles the store against `git worktree list`, so externally removed worktrees stop haunting flip/ownership logic — never hand-edit the JSON.
- DWIM land direction: naming a linked child from its origin lands it here; standing on `main` beside one unlinked worktree lands it here. Cleanup never suggests deleting `main`/`master` or removing a main working tree.
- One active worktree per session per repo: repeat creates are blocked with a pointer back at the owned link (land it first). `/worktree prune` now also heals stale store links.
- Two-command surface: `/worktree` (create one-shot) and `/land` (bare one-shot). `list`/`status`/`prune` subcommands and all `/land` flags are gone from user space — status, prune, conflict continuation and strategy live in the tools + policy for the model. Sync also prunes git metadata quietly, so no manual prune entry is needed.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- `/worktree [branch] [--base <ref>] [--path <path>] [--no-carry]` creates a linked worktree on a new branch, carrying uncommitted changes (tracked plus untracked) via a temporary stash; clean workspaces take a stash-free fast path.
- `/worktree list` (`status`), `/worktree prune`, and `/worktree help` subcommands.
- `/land [--to <path|branch>] [--strategy merge|squash] [-m <msg>] [--no-remove] [--yes]` commits pending source changes, refuses dirty targets, merges back, and cleans up (`worktree remove` plus `branch -d`) on success.
- Conflict flow: conflicted files are listed, `MERGE_HEAD` is left in place, `/land --continue` concludes after resolution and `/land --abort` rolls back; both work from either worktree.
- `worktree_status`, `worktree_create`, and `worktree_land` agent tools, plus a per-turn system-prompt policy that proactively isolates experimental, risky, or parallel work when the workspace is clean.
- Origin↔worktree linkage in `<git-common-dir>/pi-worktree.json` so `/land` survives `cd` plus fresh sessions; TUI widget and footer status for linked children and origins.
- Safety rails: no pushes, no `-D` branch deletes, stash dropped only on clean apply, dirty-target and same-path lands blocked, detached-`HEAD` sources blocked with a hint.

### Verification

- Unit plus real-git end-to-end suite: 14 tests passing (`npm test`).
- `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- Print-mode round trip verified against real Pi: dirty carry, `--yes` land with auto-cleanup, and abort/continue through a forced conflict.
- Public GitHub distribution as a Pi package (`jinhuang712/pi-worktree`).
